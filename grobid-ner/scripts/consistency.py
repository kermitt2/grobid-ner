    Consistency.py
    ======================

    Use it to check consistency (very roughly without any context).

    :Command:

    python consistency.py "absolute_path"

    Short resume
    -------------------

    Did in Python 2.7, parse each xml files of the inputdirectory to catch all ENAMEX tag and put in a dictionary the token (annotation) as the key and classes as the value.
    It just shows all keys with multiple values (with short example for each values).

    Example of results
    ------------------------

    United States Holocaust Memorial Museum  :

    INSTALLATION :  <sentence xml:id="P153E0">The <ENAMEX type="INSTALLATION">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum</ENAMEX> provides the account of <ENAMEX type="MEASURE">one</ENAMEX> survivor of
